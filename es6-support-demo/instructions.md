# ES6 Support Demo

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` to build the project
3. Look at the `bundle.js` file to see the ES6 code
4. Uncomment the code in `webpack.config.js` to see the ES5 code
5. Run `npm run build` again to see the new ES5 code generated from the ES6 code
